            <h1>About Us</h1>

             <p> Food & Beverages You may think inexpensive wine placed next to a series of more select vintages is like a thorn among lilies. But modestly priced wine pops up everywhere and exists in incredible abundance. How do you identify the best cheap wine, and is there such a thing?
            <br>
             The great food and wine critics of the world will likely raise their noses at the thought of a good bottle of cheap wine, but no matter. What makes a bottle of wine good is whether or not you enjoy it and whether or not you think it pairs well with the food that you’re eating. Keep that in mind as you try different cheap wine ideas on for size. 
             </p>
             <p class="bigletter">
             All in all, once again, a good wine isn’t about what the critics say; it’s about what your taste buds enjoy. Don’t be afraid to branch out and try something unexpected. Once you find the best cheap wine for your taste buds, you might be surprised.
